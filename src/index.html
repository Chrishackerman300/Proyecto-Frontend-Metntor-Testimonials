I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereather. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most gruelling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfuly switched careers, working as a Software Engineer ar a VR startup. "</p>

I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged ti enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistence. The agile team project, in particular, was outsanding, it took my learning to the next level in a way thar no tutorial I could ever have, in fact. I've often referred it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a-full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers, 100% recommended!
